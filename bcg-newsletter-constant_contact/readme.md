Created: 2014-11-04 - Gregory Daynes

### Introduction

This guide is to show how to get a ready to send newsletter from http://britishcolumbiagolf.org/newsletter into constant contact, and ready to send out to the mailing list.

This guide assumes the use of either Safari or Chrome web browsers, but will work in Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, and many of the lesser known browsers.

### Guide

1. Navigate to http://britishcolumbiagolf.org/newsletter in your preferred browser [Fig.1].

15. A new window will pop-up showing you a preview of the newsletter [Fig.17]. If you're happy with the preview, you can safely close the window __NOTE: If you have a pop up blocker installed, or no window appears, make sure you give the browser the ability to show popups for constant contact__
