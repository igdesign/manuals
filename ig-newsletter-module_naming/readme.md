Inside Golf Newsletter: Module Naming
-------------------------------------
Created: 2014-11-03 - Gregory Daynes

__This is a guide on how to name modules for the inside golf newsletter. this is not a step by step instruction__

The modules on the inside golf newsletter are named specially to allow for fast filtering.
eg: "3B : WC : Steu 1074"

"3B" indicates the position of the ad - "3" = newsletter
as well as the size of the ad - "B" = medium rectangle

All newsletter modules should start with "3"

Sizes are as follows
A: leaderboard
B: Medium Rectangle
C: Full Banner
D: Vertical Banner / skyscraper
E: Button

":" Colons are not necessary, but make it a little nicer to look at.

"WC" indicates the newsletter the ad is related to - WC stands for Western Canada, or all newsletters

WC: Western Canada
VI: Vancouver Island
LM: Lower Mainland
BCI: British Columbia Interior
NAB: Northern Alberta
SAB: Southern Alberta

"Steu" - The first 3 letters of the clients first word of their name, followed by the first letter of the second. Sometimes this will not work out, so adaptions need to be made.
eg: Steu - stands for St. Eugene Mission Golf Resort. St is only two letters, so we've changed the rules and added 2 letters from the second word.
Golf/Community/Resort etc - if the name ends in Golf Community, or Golf Resort etc (useless bits) we don't necessarily ad them.
eg: Cowichan Golf Resort & Country Club - following standard procedure, we'd call this "CowG" but in our case, we'll drop everything after Cowichan, and just call it "Cowi"
If the name starts with Golf, we keep it.
eg: Golf The Rock - would become GolT - Keep the "the" isn't best practice, but it's easiest just to keep it.

1074 - indicates the banner id. This is important for the filtering of ads. This allows us to find all ads with the banner  id of 1074 - if it's in multiple modules, it will show up in the list below (sometimes the ad will appear in multiple locations, LM VI BCI, but not NAB SAB - or similar)

Examples Below
3B : VI : StoP 666 = newsletter, medium rectangle, vancouver island, stony plain, banner id = 666
3E : VI : BeaG 235 = newsletter, button, vancouver island, beach gardens, banner id = 235
