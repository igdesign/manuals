### Guide

1. Log into adserver - find advertiser you wish to use for new campaign or updating campaign [Fig.1]. If advertiser doesn't exist. Refer to [Adserver client](https://github.com/igdesign/manuals/tree/master/adserver-client) on how to create a new client

4. add in descriptive text to the campaign name [Fig.5]. This is usually just the invoice/contract number. You may also add in the sites and sizes of the ads, but this is better left to the zones and banners inside the campaign.

5. Select Remnant campaign [Fig.6] and the settings will appear below

6. Set a specific date for the campaign to start. If future ad, select date for ad to start appearing. For ad to start today, select today. For ad with no start date, select today's date anyways. [Fig.7]

7. Enter CPM for per thousand ad. If ad based on tenancy, change CPM to tenancy under pricing model [Fig.8] (WCTA ads are tenancy based).
The formula for calculating CPM is
[ad cost] / (#number-of-impressions / 1000)
$295 for 30000 impressions
295 / (30000 / 1000) = 295 / 30 = $9.83 cpm
